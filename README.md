# star-classification

The dataset examined contains data from 100,000 space observations made by the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Each observation is described by 17 attributes and a variable class that identify it as a star, galaxy, or quasar. The dataset has the following FEATURES:

- obj_ID = (Object Identifier) the unique value that identifies the object in the image catalog used by the CAS
- alpha = Angle of ascension (RA - Celestial coordinates).
- delta = angle of declination (DEC - Celestial coordinates)
- u = Ultraviolet filter in the photometric system
- g = Green filter in the photometric system
- r = Red filter in the photometric system
- i = Near-infrared filter in the photometric system
- z = Infrared filter in the photometric system.
- run_ID = run ID used to identify the specific scan
- rerun_ID = Specifies the type of image processing.
- cam_col = Identifies a specific scan line belonging to a single run
- field_ID = Identifies the portion of the sky observed in a run.
- spec_obj_ID = Unique ID used to identify each scan in the dataset.
- class = Target variable: Galaxy, Star, Quasar.
- redshift = Batochrome effect, based on the increase in the wavelength of the spectrum light detected
- plate = ID identifying the spectograph used
- MJD = Date of detection
- fiber_ID = Identifies the optical fiber used on the spectograph of each observation
